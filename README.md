## Launch & Deployment
### Server
1. **Build:**
   ```sh
   ./gradlew build
   ```
   This command compiles the source code, runs tests, and packages the application.

2. **Run:**
   ```sh
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
   This starts the application on your local machine. You can verify that the server is running by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

3. **Test:**
   ```sh
   ./gradlew test
   ```
   This executes the test suite and provides feedback on the application's functionality and reliability.

4. **Deploy:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "message here"
   git push origin main
   ```
   These commands push the changes to GitHub and automatically deploy the app on Google Cloud.

## Roadmap
- **Real-Time In-Game Chat:** Add a chat function to allow players to communicate during voting.
- **Spotify OAuth Integration:** Allow users to log into their Spotify account and select songs from their playlist.
- **Full-Song Playback:** Enable players to listen to the full song during the game (requires Spotify Premium account).
